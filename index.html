        <p>The JLPT has five levels: N1, N2, N3, N4 and N5. The easiest level is N5 and the most difficult level is
          N1. N4 and N5 measure the level of understanding of basic Japanese mainly learned in class. N1and N2 measure
          the level of understanding of Japanese used in a broad range of scenes in actual everyday life. N3 is a
          bridging level between N1/N2 and N4/N5.</p>

          <h2>Listening</h2>
          <p>One of the best ways to practice listening is to, well, listen to your target language. But this doesn’t
            mean putting on some music and listening to it in the background as you do other things. You need to
            practice active listening.
            Communicate as much as possible, and your listening will naturally improve. The more people you speak with,
            the more you can train your ears.

          <h2>Reading</h2>
          <p>Reading is an effective learning activity in any language, but in Japanese it is a crucial skill. Your
            reading skill determines the ceiling of how proficient you can potentially become in the other skills
            (listening, speaking, and writing).</p>

          <div class="w3-topline">

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>Writing is one of the most important skills you can learn in Japanese. It involves creating your own
              sentences
              with all the Japanese words and grammar you’ve learned so far. Write a journal entry every day. This could
              be about anything. Something you did that day, something you learned in Japanese class, something you
              want to do in the future… the possibilities are endless!

            <h2>Speaking</h2>
            <p>
              Shadowing is a language learning technique that involves listening and repetition; it's also very simple
              to
              do! All you need is audio recording in Japanese (at your proficiency level), the transcript to that
              recording, and a pair of headphones.</p>
